# fccpythonprojectLUHNalgorithm
A python project consist of Luhn algorithm from FreeCodeCamp - Learning scientific computing

#Scientific Computing with Python - FreeCodeCamp



## About :
It's a project from the FreeCodeCamp "scientific computing with python" course which based on the Luhn algorithm to practice working with numbers and strings .

## Features :
Get the chance to know  how to use the 'maketrans' method which used to replace characters in a string .
Know the algorithm of Luhn that used to ensure the validity of credit card number for examples or IDs.

## Learning Notes :
Thanks to this project I practice as always Python syntax and how it works since it's the main tool of this course in FreeCodeCamp then the importance of this Luhn algorithm which can have it's own impact to ensure validation , detection of basic error , and it may used in payment systems so it's kind of cybersecurity thing.
